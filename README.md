# Learn GitHub via Node.js and PostgreSQL

This is a simple project that demonstrates how to interact with a PostgreSQL database using Node.js and save form data to it while learning GitHub basics.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Node.js installed on your machine
- PostgreSQL installed and running locally
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and SQL
- Basic understanding of using Git and GitHub

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/learn-github-nodejs-postgresql.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd learn-github-nodejs-postgresql
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
2. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.
3. Fill out the form with your username, email, and password, then submit.
4. Check the console logs to ensure the form data was successfully saved to the PostgreSQL database.

## Configuration

Before running the application, make sure to update the database connection settings in the `server.js` file:
- Set the correct username, hostname, database name, and port for your PostgreSQL database.

```javascript
const pool = new Pool({
  user: 'your_username',
  host: 'localhost',
  database: 'your_database_name',
  password: 'your_password',
  port: 5432,
});
```
